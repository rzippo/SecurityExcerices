There's a difference between "evolving the ability to get nutrition from a wide variety of sources" and "requiring a wide variety of food that didn't exist 100 years ago."
Humans don't require every kind of food currently available but, being omnivores, we have the ability to eat just about anything that isn't blatantly toxic 
(and even then there's wiggle room, considering many humans regularly consume the deadly toxin known as alcohol for fun).

To break it down a bit, humans need only a handful of basic nutrients: proteins, carbohydrates, fatty acids, vitamins/minerals, and water.
 Just because now we have a billion different kinds of foods that have those nutrients doesn't mean those nutrients can only come from those foods.

Barring having some kind of medical problem, your stomach and your metabolism doesn't really care whether the protein you just ate came from an antelope you ran down and killed or
from a crop of black beans and rice that you cultivated on a farm. Your body cares about whether you have protein to build muscles, not where the protein came from. 
Carbohydrates can come from a wild apple or a bag of potato chips; it doesn't matter, just that you have carbs to convert into sugars for energy. The source is irrelevant. 
Now, certain foods have better quality nutrients - the sugars and carbs from an apple are better quality than the sugars and carbs from a snickers bar, 
which is why you feel better when you eat more apples than snickers bars - but the nutrients themselves are basically the same. 
The lack of stone age snickers bars does not equal a lack of stone age sugars and carbs.
